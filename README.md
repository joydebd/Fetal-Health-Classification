# Fetal-Health
Fetal Health Problem 

1.  Import  the  “Fetal_Health”  dataset  in  CSV  format.  The  dataset  contains  2126  records  of 
features  extracted  from  Cardiotocogram  exams,  which  were  then  classified  by  three  expert 
obstetricians  into  3  classes:  Normal,  Suspect  and  Pathological.  The  dataset  contains  many 
Independent  variables  and  “fetal_health”  as  the  Dependent  variable.  Perform  the  following 
operations on the dataset.

## Predictive Analytics </br>
Apply  Decision  Tree  Classifier  on  the  dataset.  Consider  the  X  variables  as  baseline  value, 
fetal_movement, uterine_contractions, light_decelerations, severe_decelerations, 
prolonged_decelerations and abnormal_short_term_variability; and Y variable as fetal_health. 
Keep the train-test split at 70-30 ratio. 

a. What is the overall accuracy of the decision tree model?

b.  Write  the  confusion  matrix.  Discuss  the  implications  of  Type-I  error  and  Type-II  error  in 
this example.

c. What are the Precision, Recall, F1 score for the three classes, based on the confusion matrix?

d. Plot the ROC curves for the three classes.
